  description: Have you ever read an article and thought "I wonder how their calculations would pan out if I used my own value for this one constant they could only guess", or "I would really like to use that figure, but I wish I could modify their color bar", or "Nice description, but how did they actually calculate that average"? Me too. And that is why we should not only share raw data, but also work flows, computer code, and other machine-readable information. In the section below you can find supporting material for my more recent publications. The first articles for which I published all necessary material are our <a href='https://github.com/poplarShift/arctic-nitrate-fluxes'>2020 analysis of how turbulent nitrate fluxes limit algae growth across the Arctic Ocean</a> and <a href='https://github.com/poplarShift/ice-edge'>a 2019 paper on ice edge phytoplankton blooms</a>.

  description: Open source data science computer programs are more advanced than ever. I am an avid python user and contribute to the <a href='https://www.holoviews.org'>Holoviews package</a>, part of the HoloViz ecosystem of visualisation and data handling tools. You can find some of my own material in <a href='https://github.com/poplarShift/pyviz-recipes'>this repository</a>.
