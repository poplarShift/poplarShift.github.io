  title = {Turbulent {{Upper}}-{{Ocean Mixing Affected}} by {{Meltwater Layers}} during {{Arctic Summer}}},
  volume = {47},
  abstract = {AbstractEvery summer, intense sea ice melt around the margins of the Arctic pack ice leads to a stratified surface layer, potentially without a traditional surface mixed layer. The associated strengthening of near-surface stratification has important consequences for the redistribution of near-inertial energy, ice{\^a}ocean heat fluxes, and vertical replenishment of nutrients required for biological growth. The authors describe the vertical structure of meltwater layers and quantify their seasonal evolution and their effect on turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer by analyzing more than 450 vertical profiles of velocity microstructure in the seasonal ice zone north of Svalbard. The vertical structure of the density profiles can be summarized by an equivalent mixed layer depth hBD, which scales with the depth of the seasonal stratification. As the season progresses and melt rates increase, hBD shoals following a robust pattern, implying stronger vertical stratification, weaker vertical eddy diffusivity, and reduced vertical extent of the mixing layer, which is bounded by hBD. Through most of the seasonal pycnocline, the vertical eddy diffusivity scales inversely with buoyancy frequency (K{\"I} {\^a} N{\^a}1). The presence of mobile sea ice alters the magnitude and vertical structure of turbulent mixing primarily through stronger and shallower stratification, and thus vertical eddy diffusivity is greatly reduced under sea ice. This study uses these results to develop a quantitative model of surface layer turbulent mixing during Arctic summer and discuss the impacts of a changing sea ice cover.},

  copyright = {openAccess},
  isbn = {978-82-8236-253-5},
  abstract = {Upward mixing of remineralized nutrients is essential for photosynthesis in the upper ocean. Weak vertical mixing, which restricts nutrient supply, and sea ice, which leads to low light levels, conspire to severely inhibit marine primary productivity in the Arctic Ocean. However, little has been known about their relative contributions. No large-scale quantitative estimates of the vertical nutrient supply had previously been presented, which has impeded an understanding of its role in shaping the ecology and carbon cycle of the Arctic Ocean.

In order to estimate the vertical flux of nitrate into the surface layer in contrasting hydrographic and dynamic regimes, profiles of turbulent microstructure and nitrate concentrations were measured as part of a number of cruises and ice camps in the area extending from eastern Fram Strait into the Nansen Basin. These have been supplemented with obervations of the seasonal nutrient cycle at a mooring in the same area, and a reanalysis of available data on nitrate concentrations and turbulent mixing in other parts of the central Arctic Ocean.

Hydrography was found to be the biggest driver of variability in nitrate fluxes. Strong stratification, wherever encountered, restricted nitrate supply, often in concert with concurrently weak turbulent mixing, both in the seasonal nitracline (0.3\textendash{}0.7 mmol N m-2 d-1) and the deep basin (0.01\textendash{}0.2 mmol N m-2 d-1). Thus deep winter mixing supplies the bulk of the nitrate pool on the relatively productive shelves (e.g. 2.5 mmol N m-2 d-1 in the inflow of Atlantic Water during winter), but in the strongly stratified Canadian Basin, fluxes are low year-round (on the order of 0.01 mmol N m-2 d-1) and place a tight limit on new production. Only the weakly stratified Atlantic derived water in the Nansen Basin close to Fram Strait seems to have a certain potential to support future increases in new production under a seasonal ice cover.},

  volume = {5},
  issn = {2296-7745},
  abstract = {Eastern Fram Strait and the shelf slope region north of Svalbard is dominated by the advection of warm, salty and nutrient-rich Atlantic Water (AW). This oceanic heat contributes to keeping the area relatively free of ice. The last years have seen a dramatic decrease in regional sea ice extent, which is expected to drive large increases in pelagic primary production and thereby changes in marine ecology and nutrient cycling. In a concerted effort, we conducted five cruises to the area in winter, spring, summer and fall of 2014, in order to understand the physical and biogeochemical controls of carbon cycling, for the first time from a year-round point of view. We document (1) the offshore location of the wintertime front between salty AW and fresher Surface Water in the ocean surface, (2) thermal convection of Atlantic Water over the shelf slope, likely enhancing vertical {\~n}nutrient fluxes, and (3) the importance of ice melt derived upper ocean stratification for the spring bloom timing. Our findings strongly confirm the hypothesis that this ``Atlantification'', as it has been called, of the shelf slope area north of Svalbard resulting from the advection of AW alleviates both nutrient and light limitations at the same time, leading to increased pelagic primary productivity in this region.},
